research about LOCKSS

(_RLC comments in italics_)

Purpose of LOCKSS in Perma
---------------------------
-  geographically distributed backup
-  protection against bit rot
-  what else???

(should it be easy to run a read-only Perma from the contents of the LOCKSS box, in case we ever go out of business? is that the idea?)
